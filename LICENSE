Oni StratifiedJS: Multi-Platform StratifiedJS Implementation
============================================================

(c) 2010-2013 Oni Labs, http://onilabs.com

The Oni StratifiedJS distribution is made available as open-source.

All client-side components of the distribution are licensed under the MIT License.
Some server-side components are licensed under the GPL v2.

The upshot is that if you use StratifiedJS purely on the client-side via the
cross-browser stratified.js runtime and the standard module library, there
are no restrictions placed on your application.
If you use StratifiedJS on the server-side, or you use the StratifiedJS compiler
or virtual machine directly (i.e. not via stratified.js) in another product,
then that product also needs to be licensed under the GPL.

Alternative licensing available; for enquiries please contact alex@onilabs.com
