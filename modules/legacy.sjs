/**
   @function partition
   @deprecated This is a legacy function
   @altsyntax sequence .. partition(predicate)
   @param {sjs:sequence::Sequence} [sequence] Input sequence
   @param {Function} [predicate] Predicate function
   @return {Array} A pair of sequences.
   @summary  Create a pair of [passes, fails] streams from an input stream and a predicate.
   @desc
      Generates two sequences. The first contains all items `x` from `sequence` for which
      `predicate(x)` is truthy, the second contains items where it is falsy. The
      order of the original sequence is maintained in each output sequence.

      If the input is an Array or other concrete sequence, the output will be a pair of Arrays. Otherwise,
      the output will be a pair of [sjs:sequence::Stream]s which consume the input on demand.

      Note that if you pass a [sjs:sequence::Stream] to this function and then consume the
      first result before iterating over the second, `partition` will be internally buffering
      all items destined for the second stream in order to produce the first.
      So it generally only makes sense to pass a [sjs:sequence::Stream] as input when you
      are planning to iterate over both result streams concurrently.

      ### Example:

          // print first 10 odd integers:

          var [odds, evens] = integers(1,10) .. toArray .. partition(x->x%2);
          console.log("Odds: ", odds);
          console.log("Evens: ", evens);

          // will print:
          // Odds:  [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
          // Evens: [ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
*/

    var emitters = [null, null]

    var _resume = @fn.nop;

      drainer.wait();
