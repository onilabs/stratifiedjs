  @module    nodejs/tempfile
  @summary   Temporary file / directory creation
  @home      sjs:nodejs/tempfile
  @hostenv   nodejs
  @desc
    The functionality in this module is similar to that of the
    [python tempfile module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html).

    Specifically, none of the functions in this module are
    subject to race conditions during tempfile creation (which
    could be a security vulnerability).

    By default, all files and directories are created readable,
    writable and executable (for directories) _only_ by the current user.

    The file will be opened to be both readable and writable.

    If `block` is given, it will be called with the [::File] (which
    is also returned). Once `block` has finished, the file will be closed
    and deleted (if `delete` is `true`).
    
    **Note:** If you use [::File::readStream] or [::File::writeStream], there will be
    multiple open file descriptors pointing to the same file. The
    [::File::close] method will close all such streams (as well as the actual file),
    so you should use this instead of just calling [./fs::close].
