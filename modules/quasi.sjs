/**
   @class Quasi
   @summary A datastructure consisting of alternating literal strings and interpolated values
   @desc  
     A quasi is a datastructure consisting of an array, accessible through the 
     `parts` member. Elements at even (0,2,4,6,...) indices of this array are strings, 
     whereas elements at odd (1,3,5,7,...) indices can be any object type. 

     Usually a quasi is constructed using the quasi literal syntax, e.g.:

         `foo${bar}baz`

     This is the literal syntax for the quasi with `parts` equal to `['foo', bar, 'baz']`.
     I.e. elements of `parts` at even indices (0,2,4,6,...) will contain the literal string
     parts of the quasi literal, whereas the elements at odd indices (1,3,5,7,...) will
     contain the interpolated parts.

     Quasis are useful for constructing safe template grammars for HTML, SQL, 
     or similar textual language. 

     E.g. a common source of security sensitive bugs in web applications stems 
     from the mixing of literal and user supplied content to create HTML:
    
         var user_comment = retrieve_user_comment_from_db();
         var comment_html = "<pre>" + user_comment + "</pre>";
         showHtml(comment_html);

     Here, if `user_comment` has not been properly escaped, we have a classic attack 
     vector for a script injection attack. 

     Note that by the time `showHtml()` sees the HTML string it is to late to 
     escape the sensitive parts of the string: All that `showHtml()` sees is a 
     flat string; we have lost the information that the `"<pre>"`
     and `"</pre>"` parts are programmer supplied literals, whereas `user_comment` is 
     a potentially unsafe interpolated value.

     Quasi literals give us a way of retaining this information:

         var user_comment = retrieve_user_comment_from_db();
         var comment_html = `<pre>$user_comment</pre>`;
         showHtml(comment_html);

     Here, `showHtml()` will see a quasi with `parts` equal to 
     `['<pre>', user_comment, '</pre>']`. Before concatenating the parts into a final
     HTML string, it can thus make sure that the interpolated elements (at odd indices) are
     properly escaped:

         function showHtml(html) {
           var html_str = '';
           for (var i=0; i<html.parts.length; ++i) {
             if (i%2) 
               html_str += escape_for_html(html.parts[i]);
             else
               html_str += html.parts[i];
           }
           showHtmlString(html_str);
         }
*/
