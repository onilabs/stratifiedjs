@name StratifiedJS Language overview
@type doclib

@desc
  StratifiedJS executes code in logical units we call **strata**. Unlike normal JS code, strata are allowed to "block", i.e. the control flow is allowed to stop at a particular point to be picked up again later at the same point where it left off. An example would be the [::builtins::hold] function which blocks for a given period of time (but still allows other strata to be executed while it is blocking its own stratum).

  ### Concurrent strata

  While one stratum is blocked, other strata can execute. Strata
  are a bit like threads, but they are much more deterministic: Only one
  stratum is running at any one time and it is executed atomically up until
  the point where it either finishes or suspends. At that point the next pending
  stratum is executed until *it* finishes or suspends, and so forth.

  
  ## Base language

  StratifiedJS is based on the JavaScript language as originally defined in [ECMA-262 Edition 3][]. In addition, StratifiedJS supports many features defined in more recent standards, such as:

  [ECMA-262 Edition 3]: http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf

   - Rest parameters
   - Spread syntax
   - Destructuring 
  

  ## Concurrency primitives:

  StratifiedJS contains language constructs for casting asynchronous logic into
  blocking form (`waitfor()`), constructs for orchestrating the execution of multiple strata (`waitfor/and`, `waitfor/or`, `waitfor/while`, `collapse`) in a structured way, as well as a facility for implementing more complex concurrency scenarios (`reifiedStratum`).


  ### Pausing execution - [::builtins::hold]
  
  The `hold` function can be called with a number argument `t` to suspend the current stratum for ~`t` milliseconds:

      hold(1000);
      // the next code will be executed after around 1s

  Calling `hold` with an `undefined` argument suspends the current stratum indefinitely.

  
  ### Suspending execution - [::syntax::waitfor-resume]

  The `waitfor()` construct suspends the current stratum until
  explicitly resumed.
  
      waitfor() {
        // ... "suspending code block" ...
      }
      // ... next code ...

  It is typically used to create a stratified wrapper around
  plain javascript functions that make use of callback parameters.

  
  ### Fork-join composition - [::syntax::waitfor-and]

  StratifiedJS offers several different constructs for running and coordinating multiple concurrent strata. One of the most straightforward ways is to use fork-join composition - which executes multiple branches of code concurrently and continues only once all branches have completed. This is achieved with SJS's `waitfor/and` construct:

      waitfor {
        ... some code ...
      }
      and {
        ... some other code ...
      }
      ... next code ...

  ### Alt composition - [::syntax::waitfor-or]

  Alt ('alternatives') composition explores a set of alternatives concurrently,
  and resumes as soon as any code path completes.
  It is expressed with SJS's `waitfor/or` construct:

      waitfor {
        ... some code ...
      }
      or {
        ... some other code ...
      }
      ... next code ...

  ### Collapsing alternatives - [::syntax::collapse]

  The `collapse` keyword can be used to prematurely collapse the strata in a `waitfor/or` construct.


  ### Asymmetric composition - [::syntax::waitfor-while]

  In asymmetric composition, the lifetime of one stratum is controlled by the lifetime of another, but
  not the other way around.


  ### Cancellation
  
  There are a number of situations under which suspended code gets
  cancelled, e.g. when another branch in a `waitfor/or` construct finishes
  first, or when a branch in a `waitfor/and` returns early:


      function foo() {
        waitfor {
          ...some suspending code...
        }
        and {
          ...
          return;
        }
      }


  Here, if `some suspending code` is still suspended by the time of the
  `return` call in the other branch, it will be cancelled.


  Cancellation means that a suspended `waitfor()`-construct will not wait
  for a call to its corresponding `resume` any more. Also, a `hold(t)` will
  not wake up any more.
  Any code in the cancelled stratum coming after the aborted suspended code will not be executed any more.
  
  ### Handling retraction - [::syntax::try-catch-retract-finally]
  
  Cancellation can be "caught" much like exceptions using `try/retract`:

      try {
        ... some suspending code ...
      }
      retract {
        console.log("'some suspending code' has been cancelled!");
      }


  ### Accessing strata under the hood - [./syntax::reifiedStratum]

  StratifiedJS contains many higher-level concurrency primitives (such as dispatchers, semaphores, 
  conditions, ...), all built on top of the structured concurrency language features detailed above.

  For more complicated concurrency scenarios that cannot easily be implemented with these facilities, 
  StratifiedJS has the `reifiedStratum` keyword, which can be used within a function to access its 
  [./builtins::Stratum] object.

  
  ## Syntax enhancements over JavaScript

  On top of the base JavaScript language, StratifiedJS supports a number of syntactic additions. Unlike the core stratified constructs, most of these (with the notable exception of blocklambdas) are *syntactic sugar* - they don't add anything the language couldn't already do, but they provide a convenient and readable syntax for constructs that can otherwise be cumbersome to express.


  ### String interpolation - [::syntax::string-interpolation]

  *using the same syntax as Ruby and CoffeeScript*

  String interpolation allows you to insert the value of an expression into a string literal. It can only be used inside double-quotes:

      console.log("Hello, #{name}!");
      
      // equivalent to:
      console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");

  

  ### Quasi quotes - [::syntax::quasi-quote]

  *a simplified version of the ECMAScript Harmony [Quasi-Literal / Template String](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:quasis) proposal*

  Quasi-quotes ("quasis") look like strings, but are delimited by backticks
  (\`) instead of single or double quotes.

  Within a quasi, you can insert interpolated expressions by placing them inside
  `${ ... }`.

  Unlike string interpolation, a quasi-quoted value is a rich object. It maintains
  the embedded values alongside the literal portions, allowing the recipient
  to choose how embedded values are converted.


  ### Function chaining - [::syntax::double-dot]

  *created for SJS; although we later discovered [elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)'s `|>` pipe operator was created independently with the same functionality*

  The double-dot operator allows you to chain function calls in a way similar to
  a pipeline or a sequence of method invocations in a [fluent interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface).

      var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
      var even = x -> x % 2 == 0;
      
      numbers .. filter(even) .. each(console.log);
      // prints out:
      // 2
      // 4
      

  ### Blocklambda syntax - [::syntax::blocklambda]

  *adopted from the [block lambda revival](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:block_lambda_revival) proposal for ECMAScript*
  
  Blocklambdas are a cross between anonymous functions and the builtin block syntax for conditional statements, loops, function bodies, etc.

  They are commonly used with the [sequence::] module, e.g:

      items .. each {|item|
        if (item.id == id) {
          console.log("found it!");
          break;
        }
      }

  ### Arrow Function Syntax - [::syntax::arrow-function]

  *adopted from the proposed ECMA-262 Edition 6 arrow syntax and CoffeScript's arrow syntax*

  Arrow syntax is a shorthand for a function that only consists of a single expression and which returns the result of this expression.

      var add = (x, y) -> x + y;
      // equivalent to:
      var add = function(x, y) { return x + y; };

  You can also bind the current value of `this` by using the "fat arrow" variant:

      var addOne = (x) => this.add(x, 1);
      // equivalent to:
      var x = function(x) { return this.add(x, 1); }.bind(this);
