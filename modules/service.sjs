/**
   @class Service
   @summary Function-as-service abstraction
   @desc
     A Service is a function of signature `function S([optional_params...], session_func)`,
     where `session_func` is a functional argument that takes one optional 
     arguments (this argument being the service's "interface").

     When invoking `S([...],session_func)`, `S` calls `session_func` to establish a "service session". `session_func` is called with a single (possibly void) argument, the "service session interface".

     The service session lasts until `session_func` exits (at which point `S` is expected to exit).
     `session_func` will typically be a [./#language/syntax::blocklambda].

     Services will typically be named "withRESOURCE" (e.g. [sjs:nodejs/http::withServer]) or 
     "runTYPESession" (e.g. 'runEditSession').

     Formally, a service `S` is expected to adhere to the following semantics:

     - Upon invocation, `S` makes exactly one call to `session_func` (after optionally blocking for initialization).
     - `S` optionally passes one argument to `session_func` (S's 'interface').
     - The lifetime of `S` is bound by `session_func`, i.e. `S` executes for as long as `session_func` executes (barring exceptional exit). 
       When `session_func` exits, `S` will exit (after optionally blocking for cleanup in `finally` clauses).
     - `S` must return any value returned by `session_func`, or, in the case of exceptional exit by `session_func`,
     - `S` must pass through any exceptions raised by `session_func`.
     - `session_func` has 'control flow authority' over `S`. Among other things, this means 
       that `S` cannot rely on exceptions raised from within its interface to filter 
       through calls made by `session_func`. I.e. `session_func` may catch exceptions and 
       not feed them through to the `S(session_func)` call).
     - `S` is allowed to abort `session_func`, but must throw an exception if it does so.
       See the section on 'Exceptional exit' below.
     - `S` must not subvert `session_func`'s control flow authority by using blocklambda
       break/return controlflow or non-exceptional exit of the `S(session_func)` call. See
       the section on 'Control flow subversion' below.

     ### Examples:

     - Most `"with..."` functions in the sjs/mho libs are services. E.g.: [sjs:nodejs/http::withServer],
       [sjs:sequence::withOpenStream], [sjs:sys::withEvalContext], [sjs:cutil::withBackgroundStrata],
       [sjs:service::withBackgroundServices], [sjs:service::withControlledService], [mho:websocket::withWebSocketClient].

     - A logging service that in turn uses a file writer service:

           function runLoggingSession(filename, logging_session) {
             @withFileWriter(filename) {
               |{write}|
  
               var itf = {
                 log: function(str) { write("#{new Date()}: #{str}\n"); }
               };
  
               return logging_session(itf);
  
             }
           }

     ### Typical use

     - Typically a service will be used with a blocklambda as session function:

           runLoggingSession('foo.log') {
             |itf|
             ...
             itf.log(...);
             ...
           }

     - Blocklambda session functions are allowed to use blocklamda controlflow, e.g.:

           function foo() { 
             runLoggingSession('foo.log') {
               |itf|
               while (1) {
                 ...
                 itf.log(...);
                 if (...) return; // blocklambda return exits function foo
               }
             }
             // not reached
           }

     - The requirement that sessions return the result of the execution of the session function is
       so that they can be used in a js 'expression context' (as opposed to a 'statement context'), e.g.:

           // expression form:
           var creds = withCredentialsService(itf->itf.getDBCredentials());

           // statement form:
           var creds;
           withCredentialsService { |itf| creds = itf.getDBCredentials() };


     ### Exceptional exit

     In general the lifetime of a service must be bound by its `session_func`. The
     service is allowed to abort `session_func`, but it must throw an exception
     if it does so. E.g.:

         function withServer(server, session) {
           waitfor {
             while (1) {
               if (!server.ping()) throw new Error("Server gone!");
               hold(1000);
             }
           }
           or {
             return session({uptime: -> server.uptime()});
           }
         }

     A service may throw exceptions from its interface functions, but it must not 
     rely on those exceptions filtering through and causing `session_func` (and hence
     `S` itself) to be aborted. E.g. in the following example, `withAccumulator` will not
     get to see the exception raised by its interface, because it is caught within 
     `session_func`:
     

         function withAccumulator(session) {
           var accu = 0;
           return session({
             add: function(x) { if (typeof x !== 'number') 
                                  throw 'Not a number'; 
                                accu += x;
                              }
           });
         }

         withAccumulator { |{add}|
           // try-catch here prevents the exception from filtering
           // through to accumulator
           try { add('not a number'); }catch(e) {}
         }

     If we want `withAccumulator` (instead of just `add`) to exit with an error, 
     the service could be rewritten like this:
     
         function withAccumulator(session) {
           var accu = 0, raise_error;
           waitfor {
             waitfor(var err) {
               raise_error = resume;
             }
             throw err;
           }
           or {
             return session({
               add: function(x) { if (typeof x !== 'number')
                                    raise_error(new Error('Not a number');
                                  accu += x;
                                }
             });
           }
         }

     ### Control flow subversion

     A service must not 'silently' (i.e. without raising an exception) exit by
     subverting the control flow authority of `session_func`.
     E.g. in the above example, the `throw err;` line must not be omitted.
     Doing so can cause great confusion to the caller of the service.

     Additionally, blocklambda controlflow must not be used in the 
     interface functions to subvert the controlflow, because it will not work with
     services that have their interface accessed outside of their session_func (as is 
     e.g. the case when using a background service - see [::withBackgroundServices]).

     E.g., the following service would work correctly when called directly, but 
     not when called via [::withBackgroundServices]:

         function my_service(session) {
           var error_raised = false;
           return session({
             error_exit: {|| error_raised=true; break;}
           });
           if (error_raised) throw new Error('exit with error');
         }
     
*/

/**
   @function withBackgroundServices
   @altsyntax withBackgroundServices { |itf| ... }
   @summary Creates a session for running [::Service]s in the background
   @param {Function} [session_func] Function which will be executed with a [::IBackgroundServicesSession]
   @desc
     `withBackgroundServices` is used to dynamically inject services into an existing session.

     Recall that when calling a [::Service] `S(..., session_func)`, `S` itself will call
     `session_func` to establish the session from which the service's interface is accessed. 

     Sometimes this arrangement is inconvenient, and we want to dyamically inject services into
     an __existing__ session. 

     `withBackgroundServices` is used to establish such a session, and 
     [::IBackgroundServicesSession::runService] is used to inject a service into it. Injected 
     services will have their lifetime bound by the background services session (and they can also
     be terminated 'early' through the interface returned by runService).

     As an example, a server might want to open/interact with/close a file in response to 
     asynchronous user input. Because open/close calls are not necessarily balanced, this 
     code would be different to write without withBackgroundServices:

         @withBackgroundServices { 
           |bs|

           var files = {};

           while (1) {
             var [cmd,arg] = getNextCommand();
             if (cmd === 'open') {
               files[arg] = bs.runService(withFile, arg);
             }
             else if (cmd === 'close') {
               files[arg][1]();
             }
             else if (cmd === 'show') {
               display(files[arg][0].readAll());
             }
           }
         }

     to terminate the service's session. A call to `terminate` is synchronous, i.e. it only 
     returns once the service has terminated.
     `service` will have the lifetime of its session bound to the enclosing 'background 
     services session' - if the former hasn't been terminated by the time the latter exits, 
     it will be terminated then.

     on a background services session that encompasses the complete process lifetime.

     Note that services will not be shut down cleanly on process exit (i.e. `finally` clauses are not guaranteed to be executed). 
     With some hostenvs (like xbrowser), this is technically not feasible, and on others it is currently not implemented.

   @desc
     - If the service is in state 'stopping', `start` waits until the next state is reached.
     - Throws a [::ServiceUnavailableError] if the service is in state 'terminated'.
     - Starts the controlled service if it is in state 'stopped'.
     - For `sync`=`false` (the default), returns when the service is in state 'initializing' or 'running'.
     - For `sync`=`true`, returns when the service is in state 'running'. If the service cannot start
       (i.e. it moves from 'initializing' to 'stopped' or 'terminated'), [::ServiceUnavailableError] is thrown.

       Note: For `sync`=`true`, the service's session interface will be returned. It is discouraged
       to use this return value; the structured primitive [::IControlledService::use] is preferred.

     - For `sync`=`true`, returns when the service is in state 'stopped' or 'terminated'.

     - For `sync`=`false` (the default), returns when the service is in state 'stopped', 'stopping' or 'terminated'.
     - For `sync`=`true`, returns when the service is in state 'terminated'.
     - Once the 'terminated' state is reached, the enclosing [::withControlledService] session will

     `use_session_f` with the service's interface to establish a 'use session'.

     Unlike establishing a session with a direct call of a service function, a 'use session' does not bound
     the lifetime of the service. After the 'use session' exits, the service continues running until it is 
     explicitly stopped or terminated (via [::IControlledService::stop] or [::IControlledService::terminate]) or by exiting the [::withControlledService] session.

     If the service is stopped (either explicitly or by virtue of the service session exiting) or terminated while executing 
     `itf.use(f)`, `f` will be aborted and a [::ServiceUnavailableError] or, in the case of 
     termination, the exception passed to [::IControlledService::terminate] will be thrown.
     
     Attempting to use a controlled service whose associated [::withControlledService] session has exited will throw a [::ServiceUnavailableError] or the last exception (either explicitly or via [::IControlledService::terminate]) thrown by the controlled service.

        Note: State.set is synchronous, in the sense that it will execute any listeners up to 
              the point where they block, and then continue. 
              This can lead to some surprising behavior between blocking and non-blocking code.

              E.g.:
                    @withControlledService(function(sf){ try{sf()}finally{hold(0);}}) {
                      |cs|

                      console.log('not reached');
                    }
                    
              Here the 'cs.use' call will throw an exception ('done') before the console.log line
              is reached. The following code, however, WILL reach the console.log line:
              
                    @withControlledService(function(sf){ try{sf()}finally{hold(0);}}) {
                      |cs|
                      cs.use { || cs.terminate('done'); }
                      console.log('not reached');
                    }

              The reason is that in the latter case, cs.use is synchronously triggered from the 
              State.set(['running']) call above. runControlledServiceStateMachine will not 
              return the terminating exception until the code initiated by that State.set call
              blocks.

              We could make the behavior consistent by always asynchronizing the State.set call 
              (i.e. place a hold(0) in front of it). This would downgrade performance under some
              circumstances however, and it is unclear if anything would be gained by harmonizing
              behavior.
