  @module    shell-quote
  @summary   Quote and parse shell commands
  @home      sjs:shell-quote
  @desc
             This module tracks the [node-shell-quote](https://github.com/substack/node-shell-quote) library by James Halliday.

             It provides methods for parsing a string into multiple arguments, and for
             encoding an array of arguments into a single string. It uses POSIX-like
             syntax.
             
             **NOTE**: [::quote] is *not guaranteed* to safely sanitize data for use with any
             specific shell. You should not rely on it for protecting against shell-injection.

  @function quote
  @param {Array} [args]
  @return {String}
  @summary Quote an array of arguments.
  @desc
    **NOTE**: this function is *not guaranteed* to safely sanitize data for use with any
    specific shell. You should not rely on it for protecting against shell-injection.
    
    In general, you should not spawn new processes using any shell-like syntax. You should
    instead use a function that accepts an array of arguments, as passing arguments in
    this way prevents any chance of shel-injection.

    ### Example:

        console.log(quote([ 'a', 'b c d', '$f', '"g"' ]));
        // a 'b c d' \$f '"g"'

  @function parse
  @param {String} [commandLine]
  @param {optional Object} [env]
  @return {Array}
  @summary Parse a string into an array of arguments.
  @desc
    if `env` is provided, its values will be used as substitutions for any
    variable references found.

    ### Example:

        parse('beep --boop="$PWD"', { PWD: '/home/robot' });
        // --> [ 'beep', '--boop=/home/robot' ]
