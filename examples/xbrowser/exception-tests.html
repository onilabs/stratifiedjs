    <h1>StratifiedJS Exception/Linenumber Reporting</h1> 
    <p>
      StratifiedJS amends exceptions (i.e. objects of type 'Error') thrown in SJS with a few members:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>fileName</code>: Name of the SJS module (or 'inline_scriptN') where the exception originates</li>
    <li><code>lineNumber</code>: Linenumber in the SJS module/script where the exception was first thrown</li>
    <li><code>toString</code>: Will be set to a function that generates an error message augmented with the fileName/lineNumber information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When an exception isn't caught and feeds through to the
      browser's native error console, we want to get the native
      console to show an error message that contains references to the
      SJS source code and linenumber where the exception
      originates. In theory this should work automatically, because we
      override the <code>toString</code> method. In practice some
      browsers' consoles (IE, Chrome) ignore
      user-supplied <code>toString</code> methods, so StratifiedJS needs to
      jump through some hoops. For most cases this works, as you can
      verify for various scenarios below.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these scenarios should give correctly amended errors in your browser's console, like e.g.: <i>"Error: foo (in inline_script1:8)"</i> (meaning the exception was thrown in inline script 1 at line 8).
    </p>
    <p>
     Currently the only scenario that isn't working is scenario 1 (calling
      SJS from JS, and SJS throwing a synchronous exception) on IE and
      Chrome. (This is not too bad, because you can inspect
      the exception's call stack to at least get the location of the JS
      that made the SJS call.)
    </p>
    <button onclick='throwError()'>1: throwError
    JS->SJS->uncaught</button> (Not working correctly on IE and Chrome, see comment above)<br/>
    <button onclick='try { throwError()} catch(e) { if (e.message !="foo") throw "Oops, message augmented:"+e.message; throw new Error(e.message + " (in "+e.file+":"+e.line+")");}'>2: throwError JS->SJS->catch/rethrow JS</button> (Should work on all browsers)<br/>
    <button onclick='throwErrorAsync()'>3: throwError JS -> async SJS -> uncaught</button> (Should work on all browsers)<br/>
    <button id="button2">4: spawned throwError SJS -> uncaught</button> (Should work on all browsers)<br/>
